Working with pizza dough is easiest if it’s at room temperature. If the dough is frozen, defrost it in the refrigerator before bringing it to room temperature.
Prepare a large floured surface for the dough but start shaping the dough with your hands. Moving around in a circle, pull from the center out until the dough gets too large to manage by hand.
Place the dough on the floured surface and – using the palm of your hand – continue to widen the circle until you can't stretch it any further.
Let the dough rest for five minutes.
Continue to stretch with your hand. If you can't get the dough to the diameter you want with just the palm of your hand, use a well-floured rolling pin to continue to flatten it, working from the center out.
If your dough doesn’t end up perfectly pizza parlor round, the pizza will be just as good. Keep making homemade pizzas, and you’ll get better at it.
